# Overview

I am tryiing to make myself a greater software engineer when it comes to data science. I love making the data connect and want to find a way to connect that which I've found in SQL to what can be done in python.

In my program, I created a menu that asks you if you want to insert, find, change, or delete data. This menu interacts with both tables in my relational database separately, except for where employees are connected with their department. 

It incorporates the usefulness of datascience combined with the usefulness of classes and functions connected with menus.

# Relational Database

I am using a database called employee_directory.db. This database uses all tables used in this program.

# Development Environment

I used python and imported sqlite3 and time.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Refine how deleting a department affects the employees listed under it.
- Refine how deleting a department affects the deparrtments after it.
- Refine how to see the data that is being changed.
